# Nia Control Center First-Time Setup Prototype Plan

## 1. Purpose

Extend the React + TypeScript visual prototype so it starts with the **first-time user journey**, before any projects are configured.

The user must be guided from an empty Nia installation to a configured first project. After setup, the user enters the existing project, issue, workflow, progress, and artifact experience.

This remains a **visual prototype only**. Use mock data and simulated checks. Do not access the real filesystem, run shell commands, authenticate with external services, create TOML files, or call Nia.

## 2. Core Entry Logic

```text
Application starts
  ↓
Are projects configured?
  ├── No  → Welcome and first-project setup
  └── Yes → Last selected project / Project Overview
```

Use local React state or local storage to simulate whether setup has been completed.

Provide a prototype-only **Reset demo** action that clears projects and returns to the first-time Welcome screen.

## 3. First-Time User Journey

```text
Welcome
  ↓
Check environment
  ↓
Add first project
  ↓
Select local repository
  ↓
Configure code platform
  ↓
Configure issue tracker
  ↓
Select coding agent
  ↓
Select model profile
  ↓
Confirm project metadata
  ↓
Review and validate
  ↓
Project ready
  ↓
Open Project Overview
```

## 4. Setup Routes

```text
/setup/welcome
/setup/project
/setup/code-platform
/setup/issue-tracker
/setup/coding-agent
/setup/model-profile
/setup/project-details
/setup/review
/setup/complete
```

Normal product routes remain unchanged.

## 5. Welcome Screen

Route:

```text
/setup/welcome
```

Suggested content:

```text
Welcome to Nia

Set up your first project to connect its repository,
issue tracker, coding agent, and project context.

[ Add your first project ]

Already use Nia in this repository?
[ Import existing configuration ]

Prototype only: [ Load demo workspace ]
```

Behavior:

- **Add your first project** starts the setup wizard.
- **Import existing configuration** uses a simulated folder choice and shows detected configuration for review.
- **Load demo workspace** bypasses setup and loads the seeded projects/workflows from the main prototype.
- Do not show the normal product sidebar before the first project exists.

## 6. Setup Wizard Layout

Use a full-page setup flow, not a small modal.

Persistent stepper:

```text
1 Project
2 Code platform
3 Issue tracker
4 Coding agent
5 Model profile
6 Project details
7 Review
```

Layout:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Nia                                             Setup        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1 Project  2 Code  3 Issues  4 Agent  5 Model  6 Details   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│ Step title                                                   │
│ Short explanation                                            │
│                                                              │
│ Step controls                                                │
│                                                              │
│                         [ Back ] [ Continue ]                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Requirements:

- Preserve entered values between steps.
- Validate required fields inline.
- Each step has Back and Continue.
- Cancel warns that setup data will be discarded.
- Create the project only after Review and validation.

## 7. Step 1: Environment and Project Source

Route:

```text
/setup/project
```

### 7.1 Simulated environment check

Show the setup prerequisites as visual statuses:

```text
Environment check

✓ Nia installed
✓ Local Git repository support available
✓ GitHub CLI available
✓ Node.js available

[ Run check again ]
```

Also implement a missing-prerequisite state:

```text
! Coding agent prerequisite not detected

You can continue configuring the project, but setup
must be completed before a workflow can run.

[ View setup guidance ]   [ Check again ]
```

All checks are mocked. Never execute real commands.

### 7.2 Select setup mode

```text
Add your first project

(•) Use a local repository
    Select a repository already cloned on this machine.

( ) Import an existing Nia configuration
    Use a repository that already contains .nia/config.
```

### 7.3 Select local repository

```text
Project folder
[ /Users/stefan/work/healthcare-app-angular ] [ Browse ]

Detected
✓ Git repository
✓ Repository name: healthcare-app-angular
✓ Remote: GitHub
```

Use a fake folder picker with predefined repository options.

### 7.4 Import existing setup

Simulate detection of:

```text
.nia/config/agents.toml
.nia/config/project.toml
.nia/config/toolchain.toml
```

If detected, prefill the later wizard steps but allow the user to review and change all values.

## 8. Step 2: Code Platform

Route:

```text
/setup/code-platform
```

Ask where the code is hosted.

```text
Where is your source code hosted?

[ GitHub ]
[ Bitbucket ]
[ Local only ]
[ Other / Not connected ]
```

GitHub is the primary polished path.

### GitHub state

```text
GitHub

Repository
[ telerik/healthcare-app-angular          ▾ ]

Connection
✓ Connected as Stefan

[ Change account ]
```

### Local-only state

```text
Local only

Nia will use the selected local Git repository without
connecting to an external code platform.
```

Requirements:

- Keep local repository and code platform as separate concepts.
- Preserve the repository selected earlier.
- Support mock Connected, Authentication required, and Failed states.
- Do not perform OAuth or API calls.

## 9. Step 3: Issue Tracker

Route:

```text
/setup/issue-tracker
```

Options:

```text
GitHub Issues
Jira
Azure DevOps
Shortcut
Local only
Other integrations
```

Implement detailed prototype paths for **GitHub Issues** and **Local only**. Other providers may show representative mocked fields.

### GitHub Issues

```text
GitHub Issues

Repository
[ telerik/healthcare-app-angular ]

✓ Issues available

[ Test connection ]
```

### Jira example

```text
Jira

Site URL
[ https://example.atlassian.net ]

Project key
[ NIA ]

[ Connect ]
```

### Local only

```text
Local issues

Use local issue context without connecting to an
external issue-tracking system.
```

Behavior:

- Preselect GitHub Issues when GitHub is the code platform.
- Allow the user to change it.
- Do not force code platform and issue tracker to be the same.
- Simulate Connected, Needs authentication, Failed, and Not connected.

## 10. Step 4: Coding Agent

Route:

```text
/setup/coding-agent
```

Primary choices:

```text
GitHub Copilot
Claude Code
OpenCode
```

Each agent card shows:

- Agent name
- Short neutral description
- Installed / Not detected
- Authenticated / Authentication required

Example:

```text
GitHub Copilot

✓ Installed
✓ Authenticated through GitHub

[ Use GitHub Copilot ]
```

Alternate state:

```text
Claude Code

! Authentication required

Authentication must be completed before workflows can run.

[ View setup guidance ]   [ Check again ]
```

Behavior:

- Store the selected agent in setup state.
- **Check again** changes a predefined mock state.
- **View setup guidance** opens a drawer with static guidance and a documentation link.
- Do not install or authenticate an agent.

## 11. Step 5: Model Profile

Route:

```text
/setup/model-profile
```

Options:

```text
Stable
Default profile

Balanced
Balanced capability and usage

Lite
Lower-cost experimentation
```

Preselect **Stable**.

Keep this at profile level. Do not introduce detailed model-by-model configuration during first-time setup.

## 12. Step 6: Project Metadata

Route:

```text
/setup/project-details
```

Required fields:

```text
Project name
Project description
Primary language
Frameworks
Testing framework
Package manager
```

Suggested form:

```text
Tell Nia about this project

Project name *
[ healthcare-app-angular ]

Description *
[ Healthcare sample application ]

Primary language *
[ TypeScript                         ▾ ]

Frameworks *
[ Angular, RxJS                         ]

Testing framework *
[ Jest                                  ]

Package manager *
[ npm                                ▾ ]
```

Simulate repository detection and prefill suggested values.

Label them:

```text
Suggested from repository
```

All values remain editable. Continue is disabled until every required field is provided.

## 13. Step 7: Review and Validate

Route:

```text
/setup/review
```

Example:

```text
Review project setup

PROJECT
healthcare-app-angular
/Users/stefan/work/healthcare-app-angular
                                             Edit

CODE PLATFORM

                                             Edit

ISSUE TRACKER

                                             Edit

PROJECT DETAILS
TypeScript · Angular · Jest · npm
                                             Edit
```

Optionally show which conceptual configuration files would exist:

```text
.nia/config/agents.toml
.nia/config/project.toml
.nia/config/toolchain.toml
```

Do not show raw TOML by default. A secondary **Preview configuration** action may open a read-only conceptual preview.

Primary action:

```text
[ Validate and add project ]
```

Simulated validation sequence:

```text
Validating repository...
Validating integrations...
Validating coding agent...
Validating project metadata...
```

Success proceeds to Setup Complete.

Error example:

```text
Setup needs attention

! GitHub Issues connection could not be validated.

[ Back to Issue tracker ]   [ Try again ]
```

## 14. Setup Complete

Route:

```text
/setup/complete
```

```text
Your project is ready

healthcare-app-angular has been added to Nia.

✓ Repository configured
✓ Issue tracker configured
✓ Coding agent selected
✓ Project context complete

[ Open project ]

[ Review configuration ]
```

**Open project** must:

1. Add the new project to local prototype state.
2. Add it to the project sidebar.
3. Enter the normal Control Center shell.
4. Navigate to the new Project Overview.

## 15. Returning User and Add Another Project

When at least one project exists, open the standard application shell.

The sidebar's **Add project** action reuses the same wizard with the title:

```text
Add another project
```

Differences:

- Cancel returns to the existing project.
- User-level defaults, such as coding agent and model profile, may be prefilled.
- Completion opens the new project's Overview.

Do not create a separate wizard.

## 16. Setup State Model

```ts
type ConnectionStatus =
  | "not_checked"
  | "checking"
  | "connected"
  | "needs_authentication"
  | "failed";

type SetupMode = "new" | "import";

type CodePlatform = "github" | "bitbucket" | "local" | "other";

type IssueTracker =
  | "github_issues"
  | "jira"
  | "azure_devops"
  | "shortcut"
  | "local"
  | "other";

type CodingAgent = "github_copilot" | "claude_code" | "opencode";

type ModelProfile = "stable" | "balanced" | "lite";

type ProjectMetadata = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  language: string;
  frameworks: string[];
  testingFramework: string;
  packageManager: string;
};

type ProjectSetupState = {
  step: number;
  mode: SetupMode;
  localPath: string;
  repositoryDetected: boolean;
  existingConfigurationDetected: boolean;
  codePlatform: CodePlatform;
  codePlatformStatus: ConnectionStatus;
  issueTracker: IssueTracker;
  issueTrackerStatus: ConnectionStatus;
  codingAgent: CodingAgent;
  agentInstalled: boolean;
  agentAuthenticated: boolean;
  modelProfile: ModelProfile;
  metadata: ProjectMetadata;
  validationStatus: "idle" | "validating" | "valid" | "invalid";
};
```

Use React Context and hooks or the prototype's existing lightweight state store.

## 17. React Components

```text
src/
├── setup/
│   ├── SetupLayout.tsx
│   ├── SetupStepper.tsx
│   ├── WelcomePage.tsx
│   ├── ProjectSourceStep.tsx
│   ├── EnvironmentCheck.tsx
│   ├── CodePlatformStep.tsx
│   ├── IssueTrackerStep.tsx
│   ├── CodingAgentStep.tsx
│   ├── ModelProfileStep.tsx
│   ├── ProjectMetadataStep.tsx
│   ├── SetupReviewStep.tsx
│   ├── SetupValidation.tsx
│   ├── SetupCompletePage.tsx
│   ├── ConnectionStatus.tsx
│   └── SetupGuidanceDrawer.tsx
```

Reuse the prototype's existing buttons, cards, badges, fields, drawer, and status components.

## 18. Mock Data

Repository choices:

```text
/Users/stefan/work/healthcare-app-angular
/Users/stefan/work/project-nia
/Users/stefan/work/new-project
```

Synthetic detected metadata for the primary demonstration:

```text
Name: healthcare-app-angular
Description: Healthcare sample application
Language: TypeScript
Frameworks: Angular, RxJS
Testing framework: Jest
Package manager: npm
```

Keep these values clearly inside prototype mock data. They are not real repository analysis.

Provide deterministic states for:

- Connected
- Authentication required
- Connection failed
- Recheck succeeds
- Configuration detected
- Configuration not detected
- Validation succeeds
- Validation fails

```

## 21. Acceptance Criteria

### First-time entry

- No-project state opens Welcome rather than an empty dashboard.
- Add your first project is the primary action.
- The demo workspace can still be loaded for presentations.

### Required setup

- User can select a simulated local repository.
- User can import a simulated existing Nia configuration.
- User can choose a code platform.
- User can independently choose an issue tracker.
- User can select GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or OpenCode.
- User can select Stable, Balanced, or Lite.
- User can review/edit project name, description, language, frameworks, testing framework, and package manager.
- User can review all decisions before creating the project.

### State coverage

- Environment checks support success and missing-prerequisite states.
- Connections support Connected, Authentication required, and Failed.
- Validation supports loading, success, and actionable failure.

### Completion

- Completing setup creates a project in local prototype state.
- The project appears in the sidebar.
- Open project navigates to Project Overview.
- Add project reuses the wizard after onboarding.
- Reset demo returns to first-time state.

### Scope control

- No shell commands are executed.
- No repository is scanned.
- No real authentication occurs.
- No external API is called.
- No real Nia configuration is created.
- No TOML file is modified.

## 22. UX Success Questions

The setup should let a first-time user answer:

1. **What project am I adding?**
2. **Where is its code hosted?**
3. **Where do its issues come from?**
4. **Which coding agent will Nia use?**
5. **What project context will Nia provide to the agent?**
6. **Is the setup ready, or what still needs attention?**
7. **What happens after setup is complete?**

The onboarding is successful when the transition from an empty installation to the first Project Overview is clear and does not require CLI knowledge.
